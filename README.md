The arrows in the graph represent the 'coaches' relationship. That is, an arrow from A to B means A coaches B. 

For limited infection I made the assumption that if a person had students (i.e, was a coach), 
then that person was competent enough to handle different website versions. Thus, I prioritized
pure students having the same version as their coach, but coach-students could live without
having the same version as their coach if it allowed for a reasonable deviation from the target
number of infected users.
